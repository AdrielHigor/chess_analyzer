## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key (for AI analysis features)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd chess_analyzer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

## Usage

### Playing Chess
1. **Making Moves**: Enter coordinates in the "From" field (e.g., "e2") to select a piece
2. **View Legal Moves**: Available moves will be highlighted on the board
3. **Complete Move**: Enter the destination in the "To" field (e.g., "e4")
4. **Game Status**: Current player, check status, and game outcome are displayed
